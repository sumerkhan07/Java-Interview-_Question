What is java?
Java is a high-level, object-oriented, and platform-independent programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995, now owned by Oracle.
It follows the ‘Write Once, Run Anywhere’ principle, meaning Java code can run on any device that has the Java Virtual Machine installed.
Java is known for being secure, robust, and scalable, which is why it’s used in a wide range of applications—from Android apps and web applications 
to enterprise systems and banking solutions. Its strong memory management and built-in security features make it a preferred choice for reliable 
software development.

What are JAVA features?
Java offers several key features that make it popular among developers:
Platform Independent – Java code runs on any system with a JVM.
Object-Oriented – Encourages modular and reusable code using concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Simple – Its syntax is straightforward and easy to learn for those familiar with C/C++.
Secure – Provides built-in security features like bytecode verification and no explicit pointer use.
Robust – Strong memory management and exception handling reduce errors.
Multithreaded – Supports multiple threads for concurrent execution.
High Performance – Uses Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation for faster execution.
